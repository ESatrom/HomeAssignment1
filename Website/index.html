                &emsp;I'm Elijah Satrom. I'm majoring in Computer Science at NDSU and am currently of junior standing.
                <br><br>&emsp;I'm a triplet. We originally lived in Marshall, Minnesota, but moved to Fargo when we were 4, where we then grew up. We went to Davies High School where we participated in various activities, graduated, and are now going to NDSU.
                <br><br>&emsp;I have few current plans for my future beyond graduation. I intend to get a job in the field of software development, but have not yet narrowed it down beyond that. I have no other major aspirations.
